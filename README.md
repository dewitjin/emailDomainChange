## Synopsis

This is an example of how to read and write files using C (programming language).

## Code Example

The code is pretty short so please review the index.c file.

This gist of it is that the app reads from a file dataIn.txt that looks like this:

The data is printed out to the console like this:

Then the data is written to a file dataOut.txt and looks like this:

## Motivation

I wanted to upload this to my github because it is a good starting point to introduced developers on how to read and write files in C.
Currently, I am learning C and found this lab assignment to be very informative.  I think it could be a good starting point 
for many interesting projects ahead for me and for anyone else that wants to fork this code.

## Installation

In order to run this code, you need an integrated development environment like Visual Studio.  This program is created 
using Visual Studio 2015 and started with an empty console application.

## API Reference

None.

## Tests

None.
